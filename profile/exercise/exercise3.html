        <p><em>Bangkok</em> is the capital and most populous city of Thailand. It is known in Thai as 
        Krung Thep Maha Nakhon or simply Krung Thep. The city occupies 1,568.7 square kilometres 
        (605.7 sq mi) in the Chao Phraya River delta in central Thailand and has a population of over 
        eight million, 12.6 percent of the country's population. Over fourteen million people 
        (22.2 percent) lived within the surrounding Bangkok Metropolitan Region at the 2010 census, 
        making <em>Bangkok</em> the nation's primate city, dwarfing Thailand's other urban centres in both size 
        and importance to the national economy.</p>
